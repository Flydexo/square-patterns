# Square Pattern Math exercice

This program was created when I was getting bored in math while the class was resolving a math problem (quite simple). I decided to 
create a program to automate this task and generated square patterns as in the math problem.

## draw.js

The draw.js file is quite simple, it's objective is to draw the pattern with the letters we give him in config.js:28

## guess.js

The guess.js file is a little bit more complex than draw.js because it is to guess the letters that were used to draw the square pattern in cofig.js:19
